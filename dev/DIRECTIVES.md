# web-net &mdash; Engineering Directives

> Engineering standards and the definition of done for this project. Read alongside `REPS.md` (root, authoritative), [`PLAN.md`](./PLAN.md) (design and decisions), and [`ROADMAP.md`](./ROADMAP.md) (current phase). If anything here conflicts with `REPS.md`, `REPS.md` wins, except where `PLAN.md` records an approved exception.

## 0. Philosophy

This library is built and maintained to a production standard and treated as a flagship piece of work. Plan the full path, then build one verified step at a time. "Good enough" is treated as a defect. It is a member of the owner's `-net` domain and part of the web and service stack (net-io, serve-net, web-net, the protocol engines, and the security crates). Every input from the network is hostile until proven otherwise.

---

## 1. What this is

web-net is the web framework: router, handlers, extractors, middleware with checkpoints, the HTTP adapters for serve-net's security slots, static files, rendering through a trait, and error pages. It runs inside serve-net and never touches sockets. See `PLAN.md` sections 1 and 2.

## 2. Engineering law (non-negotiable)

- **Ours, not rented.** No third-party runtime dependency, except the exceptions recorded in `PLAN.md` (audited cryptography through `crypt-io`; rustls in `tls-net` only). First-party crates are wired when first used, at published versions (no `path` dependencies across repositories). Dev-only test tooling (`criterion`, `proptest`) is allowed.
- **Sans-IO where it is a protocol.** A protocol engine does no I/O: bytes in, events out; messages in, bytes out. Transport belongs to net-io and serve-net.
- **Strict standards.** Follow the RFCs exactly. Input that two implementations could interpret differently is refused, never repaired.
- **Unsafe.** `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. This crate has no reason to touch raw memory or the OS directly.
- **Hostile-input hardening.** Explicit budgets for bytes, time, and counts, each checked before the resource is committed; no reachable panics; no quadratic paths; linear-time scanning.
- **Fail closed.** When a check cannot run, the answer is no.
- **Secrets.** Compared in constant time, zeroized after use, never in logs, errors, or `Debug` output.
- **Performance.** Peak is the baseline: zero-copy views, allocation-free hot paths, no "faster" claim without `criterion` numbers at realistic scale.
- **Cross-platform.** Linux, macOS, and Windows are first-class, verified by CI on stable and MSRV 1.85.
- **Error handling.** Every fallible path returns `Result`; errors are `#[non_exhaustive]`, precise, and say what was refused.
- **Production-ready.** `#![deny(missing_docs)]`; no `unwrap`/`expect`/`todo!`/`dbg!`/printing in library code; every public item has rustdoc with a runnable example; every claim in the docs maps to a test.

## 3. Definition of done

1. Compiles clean on Linux/macOS/Windows, stable and MSRV 1.85.
2. `fmt`, `clippy -D warnings` (all targets, all/no-default features), `test --all-features`, `cargo doc -D warnings` clean.
3. `cargo audit` + `cargo deny check` pass.
4. No `unwrap`/`expect`/`todo!`/`dbg!` in shipping code.
5. A Tier-1 API exists and headlines the docs.
6. Standards cases as data, run whole and split at every byte; property tests for every section-4 invariant; a fuzz target for every parser or decoder; every threat in `PLAN.md` has an attack test that must fail.
7. Hot-path changes carry benchmarks; no regression over 5%.
8. `README.md`, `docs/API.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` updated; the matching `docs/release/vX.Y.Z.md` written before the tag.
9. `PLAN.md` decision log updated for every design decision made during the work.
10. v1.0.0 only after the first site has used the API end to end, and after an adversarial review with every finding fixed test-first.

## 4. Project-specific invariants

- An app with a route missing its contract or permission refuses to start.
- Two spellings of one path always reach the same route; dot segments never match.
- Route matching is allocation-free and linear in the number of segments.
- A connection-gate checkpoint runs at every middleware boundary.
- No error response contains internal details.
- Static files never resolve outside their root.

---

## 5. Writing style

- Plain, specific, human prose in every shipping file. No marketing voice.
- Banned in shipping files: "comprehensive", "robust", "seamless", "leverage", and the em-dash character (U+2014) in prose.
- Commits: imperative present tense, descriptive subject line.
